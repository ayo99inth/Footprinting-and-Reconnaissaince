# Footprinting-and-Reconnaissaince
Footprinting and reconnaissance are critical first steps in the penetration testing process, aimed at gathering information about a target's network, systems, and infrastructure.
The resources in this repository will assist cybersecurity professionals in identifying potential entry points, mapping networks, and understanding the security posture of a target before deeper security assessments.

#Features:
Network Scanning: Tools for mapping and scanning IP addresses, ports, and services.
Domain Information Gathering: Scripts to extract DNS records, WHOIS information, and subdomain enumeration.
Social Engineering Resources: Techniques for gathering information from public sources, including social media and databases.
Website Reconnaissance: Web scraping tools and scripts for identifying exposed directories, files, and technologies.
Passive and Active Reconnaissance: Tools for both stealthy passive data collection and active probing for information.

#Use Cases:
Penetration Testing: Initial reconnaissance before active exploitation.
Red Team Engagements: Supporting offensive security teams in mapping and analyzing targets.
Vulnerability Assessments: Enhancing vulnerability discovery by understanding the targetâ€™s external footprint.
